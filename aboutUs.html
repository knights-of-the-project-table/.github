                <p><img class="img1" src="img/assets/about-us/hannah-hwang.jpg" />Hannah is currently working as a
                    pharmacy
                    technician in an independent pharmacy where she has been working for just over three years. She
                    decided that she wanted to make a career change because she realized that supporting herself
                    financially as a pharmacy technician was not going to be possible in the future. She learned about
                    software development through friends who are in the field, and after doing some reseach and learning
                    a bit on her own, she decided to take the step into taking classes at Code Fellows. Since she has
                    always loved putting things together and problem-solving, she is excited to have found something she
                    could enjoy and become passionate about. She plan on utilizing the skills she has learned in her
                    past job experiences as well as the knowledge she has gained at Code Fellows to become a
                    well-equipped software developer.</p>
