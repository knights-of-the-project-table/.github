                <p><img class="img1" src="img/assets/about-us/dannertaylor.jpg" />Danner is currently working in the
                    financial industry as a banker. He is also a co-founder, CEO, and CFO for a start-up tech company in
                    the Cayman Islands, developing a hub for local services. He decided to learn about software
                    development to pivot his career from the traditional financial industry to the fintech-oriented
                    industry. Danner also wants to know how to code to be able to assist in the development of his
                    start-up company. He plans to advance his technical knowledge in python to focus more on data
                    analysis and building dashboards. He believes that his new technical skills, paired with his
                    experience in the traditional financial industry, will boost his career in the fintech industry.</p>

                <p><img class="img1" src="img/assets/about-us/hannah-hwang.jpg" />Hannah is currently working as a
                    pharmacy
                    technician in an independent pharmacy where she has been working for just over three years. She
                    decided that she wanted to make a career change because she realized that supporting herself
                    financially as a pharmacy technician was not going to be possible in the future. She learned about
                    software development through friends who are in the field, and after doing some reseach and learning
                    a bit on her own, she decided to take the step into taking classes at Code Fellows. Since she has
                    always loved putting things together and problem-solving, she is excited to have found something she
                    could enjoy and become passionate about. She plan on utilizing the skills she has learned in her
                    past job experiences as well as the knowledge she has gained at Code Fellows to become a
                    well-equipped software developer.</p>

                <p><img class="img1" src="img/assets/about-us/araceli-garcia.png" />Araceli
                    is originally from Barcelona but
                    currently living in the Cayman Islands. After finishing high school she started her Bachelor's
                    Degree in
                    English & German Translation and Interpreting, however during her third year she realized that
                    wasn't the path she wanted to follow. Is then when she started her Bacherlor's Degree in Tourism and
                    Hotel Management. After finishing her degree she worked in three luxury hotels, being the last one
                    the Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa, located in the Cayman Islands, where she was Travel & Leisure
                    Coordinator. Working in the hospitality industry has allowed her to travel and live in different
                    places, which is something that she loves. However in 2021 she was offered a job at Cayman
                    Enterprise City, a tech oriented company that operates in the Special Economic Zone, which later
                    would make her want to be part of the constantly evolving and vibrant tech commuty.</p>
